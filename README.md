# Contribution
Anybody is welcome to collaborate in this project. Feel free to push any pull request (even if you are new to coding).

Note: the idea of this project is to build a really simple blockchain system, so make sure all your code is easy to read (avoid too much code in 1 line) and don't introduce complex updates if they are not critical. In other words, keep it simple.
